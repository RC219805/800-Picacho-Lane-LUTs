# Daily Repository Review â€” 2025-02-14

## Summary
- Reviewed luxury TIFF adjustment pipeline with focus on clarity handling and tone mapping options.
- Identified lack of support for negative clarity adjustments, which limited soft-proofing scenarios.
- Verified existing tone mapping utilities remain unused in production modules; opportunity for future integration remains.

## Actions Taken
- Extended clarity routine to support negative values for material softening while retaining boost behavior.
- Added regression coverage demonstrating clarity softening and boosting relative to Gaussian baseline.

## Recommendations
- Explore routing tone mapping helpers into CLI presets for high dynamic range workflows.
- Consider profiling Gaussian blur cache performance under large batch runs; kernel reuse could be logged for observability.
