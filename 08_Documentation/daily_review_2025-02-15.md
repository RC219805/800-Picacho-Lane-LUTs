# Daily Repository Review â€” 2025-02-15

## Summary
- Audited clarity adjustment logging after recent negative-value support.
- Confirmed automated test coverage continues to exercise both boost and soften pathways.
- Reviewed CI workflow definitions for linting and testing to ensure parity with local runs.

## Actions Taken
- Restored clarity debug logging to the legacy message key while appending mode metadata for analytics compatibility.
- Refactored clarity softening branch to reuse the cached high-pass result, avoiding redundant blur math.

## Recommendations
- Capture structured metrics around clarity radii during batch jobs to validate field usage of the softening mode.
- Evaluate whether glow and clarity interactions warrant joint tuning in future preset updates.
