# Daily Repository Review â€” 2025-02-16

## Summary
- Investigated CI lint failures caused by unresolved heavy ML imports and missing dev dependencies.
- Audited workflow triggers and dependency caching strategies for lint and test jobs.
- Confirmed repository dependency manifests lack explicit development tooling coverage.

## Actions Taken
- Authored a focused requirements-dev.txt that layers lint/test tooling on top of runtime deps without pulling heavyweight ML libraries.
- Introduced a .pylintrc tuned to ignore tests during lint and silence missing-module noise for torch-based integrations.
- Rebuilt the lint and test GitHub Actions workflows with dependency caching, editable installs, and explicit torch/diffusers provisioning for the test matrix.

## Recommendations
- Monitor CI runtime after the heavier test installation to determine whether CPU-only torch wheels remain acceptable for matrix coverage.
- Consider defining optional dependency groups in pyproject.toml (e.g., [project.optional-dependencies]) to centralize dev vs. runtime environments.
- Track future additions of ML modules so the ignored-modules list and runtime install step stay synchronized.
