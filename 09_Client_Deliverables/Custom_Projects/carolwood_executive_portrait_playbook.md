# Carolwood "In-Command, In-Conversation" Portrait Playbook

## Brand Objective
Carolwood's executive portraiture must communicate a paradoxical blend of precision and approachability. The hero frame should feel decisive yet warm, exacting yet human—someone a client would both trust with a landmark estate and call first for counsel.

## Expression Architecture
- **Eyes set the authority**: direct gaze into the lens with a gentle micro-squint (lower-lid engagement, brows neutral).
- **Mouth carries warmth**: corners lifted 2–3°, lips barely parted to read as engaged rather than posed.
- **Favor asymmetry**: subtle left–right variation (e.g., half-smile toward one eye) conveys live cognition instead of a static photo-face.
- **Prompt cadence**:
  - “Picture a client asking, ‘What would you do?’—give me the I’ve-got-you look.”
  - “Say a silent ‘yes’ as if the plan just clicked.”
  - “Breathe in through the nose, soft exhale, eyes stay with me.”

## Temporal Dynamics Protocol
- **Burst the decision echo**: fire a 3–5 frame sequence while delivering the “silent yes” cue. The target hero almost always lands **0.3 seconds after** the peak micro-smile when the expression settles into confident composure.
- **Track the decay curve**: review the sequence like a waveform—frame 1 carries anticipation, frame 2 the decision, frame 3 the resolution. Select the frame where the eyes remain locked yet the mouth has eased, preserving authority while keeping the warmth resonant.
- **Log micro-adjustments**: note the shutter timestamp and expression prompts that produced the keeper. These become repeatable heuristics for future sessions or other executives.

## Posture, Hands, and Body Language
- Chin out, then 5–10 mm down to define the jaw without defiance.
- Shoulders open with a 2–4 cm micro-lean toward camera to signal availability.
- Hands in "active rest": soft steeple or relaxed overlap on the desk, no tension or props unless meaningful. Rotate the watch correctly.

## Composition Framework
- **Aspect ratio**: 4:5 for the leadership grid.
- **Eye-line**: 27% ±2% from the top edge.
- **Brand band**: reserve 10–18% of the frame for the CAROLWOOD / ESTATES wordmark.
- **Side gutters**: 12–16% per side.
- **Lower crop**: include upper chest; keep hands visible but below the primary attention band (~68–80% frame height).
- **Centerline**: nose on the vertical center.
- **Environmental press variant**: shift to 2:3, lift eye-line to 36%, retain signage and desk as narrative anchors.

## Light Design
- **Key**: 5′ octa or 4×6 softbox, 30–35° off-axis, 10–15° above eye-line.
- **Fill**: –1.0 to –1.5 stops relative to key to maintain contour without harsh contrast.
- **Rim/Hair**: subtle edge light from camera-opposite, feathered to separate jacket and background by ~3–5 L* values.
- **Background**: neutral gray gradient (#4a4c48 → #8c8e8a) held ~⅓ stop darker than skin; add a light top grad to protect the wordmark.
- **Negative fill**: small black flag on the shadow side to keep the jawline crisp.

## Camera & Exposure Notes
- Focal length 85–105 mm equivalent at f/3.5–f/4.5 (sharp face, gently softened background).
- Camera height at the collarbone with a micro-tilt (<1°) downward to avoid nostril dominance.
- Shutter ≤1/160–1/200, low ISO.
- Optional: 1/8 Black Pro-Mist for subtle highlight bloom control.

## Wardrobe Calibration
- Crisp white shirt with a medium-contrast jacket; matte lapels outperform high sheen in monochrome delivery.
- Avoid tight herringbone or other patterns prone to moiré.
- Remove pocket square unless it serves a specific brand cue.

## Retouching Principles
- Preserve skin texture; remove distractions without plasticity.
- Micro dodge & burn: lift eye sockets 2–4 points, soften under-eye lines without erasing.
- Cool and lift teeth/sclera minimally—avoid paper white.
- Clean dust and lint on the jacket; reduce cuff glare; even out specular highlights along the desk.
- Apply a gentle S-curve grade with slightly lifted blacks; export sRGB.

## Frame Selection Guidance
Using the provided four monochrome frames (A–D, left to right):
- **Frame B (Hero Recommendation)**: Direct gaze, balanced micro-squint, and a "silent yes" mouth position deliver the decisive-warm equilibrium. Shoulders are open, hands relaxed, and the brand band remains unobstructed—ideal as the universal portrait.
- **Frame A**: Marginally cooler mouth expression; reserve for institutional trust collateral (board decks, investor packets) where authority should lead.
- **Frame C**: Slightly wider smile diminishes the command presence; suitable for relational touchpoints when additional warmth is needed.
- **Frame D**: The broadest smile and subtly raised shoulders trade precision for approachability; keep for informal communications only.
- **Temporal selection tip**: When reviewing burst captures, bias toward the frame that sits at the center of the expression spectrum—the one that can read warmer or cooler depending on audience needs. This "universal solvent" frame becomes the adaptable hero across channels.

## Shot List to Bank
1. **Boardroom Credible** – cooler mouth tone, identical eye authority (Frame A analogue).
2. **In-Conversation** – micro-smile with direct eyes (Frame B analogue).
3. **Environmental Press** – 2:3 ratio with signage and desk anchors.

## Quick On-Set Checklist
- 4:5 frame, eyes at 27%, brand band 10–18%, 12–16% side gutters.
- Key light 30–35° off-axis, fill –1.25 stops, subtle rim, neutral gray background.
- Chin out/down, shoulders open, micro-lean, hands in active rest.
- Direct gaze + micro-squint, corners up 2–3°, run the “silent yes” cue.

## Presence Compiler (For Creative Leads)
Treat the playbook as a trust-building algorithm:

```
generate_trust() {
  set_authority(eyes, micro_squint, 0.7);
  set_warmth(mouth, corner_lift_deg=2.3);
  balance_asymmetry(expression, cognitive_bias=true);
  embed_temporal_echo(sequence_length=5, keeper_offset=0.3s);
  return composite_presence;
}
```

Use the function as shorthand during reviews: verify the parameters, confirm the temporal echo, and sign off when the composite presence reads decisively human.
